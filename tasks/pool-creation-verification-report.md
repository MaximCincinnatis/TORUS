# TORUS/TITANX Pool Creation Timeline Verification Report

## Executive Summary

The verification confirms that **block 22890272 is the EXACT pool initialization block** and is perfectly positioned to capture all LP activity. There are no gaps in data collection.

## Key Findings

### 1. Pool Creation
- **Pool Address**: `0x7ff1f30F6E7EeC2ff3F0D1b60739115BDF88190F`
- **Initialize Block**: `22890272`
- **Initialize Date**: July 10, 2025 at 17:28:35 UTC
- **Transaction**: `0x9153f645f1a42b63b1e5e669e650e7f22a49f15f89cf0228d800e9a5aec51815`
- **Initial Price**: ~10,000 TITANX per TORUS (tick 161189)

### 2. First LP Activity
- **First Mint Block**: `22890627` (355 blocks after initialization)
- **First Mint Time**: July 10, 2025 at 18:39:59 UTC (~71 minutes after pool creation)
- **First LP Provider**: Added 20,000 TORUS and ~200B TITANX
- **Price Range**: Full range position (-887200 to 887200 ticks)

### 3. Early LP Activity Pattern
The first 10 LP positions show:
- All positions created through Uniswap V3 Position Manager (`0xC36442b4a4522E871399CD717aBDD847Ab11FE88`)
- Mix of full-range and concentrated liquidity positions
- Initial activity concentrated in first 3 days (July 10-13, 2025)
- Positions ranging from small (2.14 TORUS) to large (20,000 TORUS)

### 4. Current Pool State
- **Current Tick**: 177470
- **Current Price**: ~50,937,640 TITANX per TORUS
- **Price Appreciation**: ~5,094x since initialization
- **Recent Activity**: No new positions in last 100 blocks (monitoring period)

## Data Collection Verification

### ✅ Block 22890272 is PERFECT because:

1. **Exact Match**: It's the exact block where the pool was initialized
2. **No Early Misses**: First LP position came 355 blocks AFTER our starting point
3. **Complete Coverage**: We capture the pool from its very beginning
4. **No Wasted Resources**: We don't search unnecessarily early blocks

### Timeline Confirmation:
```
Block 22890272: Pool Initialize Event ← WE START HERE ✅
     ↓ (355 blocks / ~71 minutes)
Block 22890627: First Mint Event (First LP position)
     ↓
Block 22891011: Second LP position
     ↓
... continuing LP activity
```

## Recommendations

1. **KEEP CURRENT CONFIGURATION**: Block 22890272 should remain as the starting point for:
   - `DEPLOYMENT_BLOCK` in update scripts
   - `POOL_CREATION_BLOCK` in LP scanning logic

2. **No Changes Needed**: The current implementation correctly starts at pool initialization

3. **Data Integrity**: All historical LP positions from pool inception are being captured

## Technical Details

### Pool Parameters at Creation:
- **Fee Tier**: 10000 (1%)
