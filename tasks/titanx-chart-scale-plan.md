# TitanX Usage Chart Scale Issue - Analysis & Plan

## Problem Summary

The "TitanX used each day" bar chart shows stakes as invisible because of extreme scale differences:
- **Stakes**: Average 378 TitanX (min: 3, max: 2,146)
- **Creates**: Average 139.7 BILLION TitanX (min: 300M, max: 1.16 TRILLION)
- **Scale Ratio**: Creates are 369 MILLION times larger than stakes on average

Stakes represent only 0.0000% to 0.0008% of creates - making them invisible on linear scale.

## Current Solution Available

The chart already has a **"Linear/Log" toggle button** that solves this issue:
- Located in the top-right corner of the chart
- When clicked to "Log" mode, both stakes and creates become visible
- This is the intended solution for extreme scale differences

## Analysis of Options

### Option 1: Use Existing Log Toggle (RECOMMENDED) âœ…
**Pros:**
- Already implemented and working
- Standard solution for extreme scale differences
- Preserves accurate data representation
- No code changes needed

**Cons:**
- Requires user to know to click the toggle
- Default linear view shows stakes as invisible

### Option 2: Default to Log Scale
**Pros:**
- Users see both datasets immediately
- No user action required

**Cons:**
- Log scale can be confusing for non-technical users
- Linear scale is more intuitive for most people
- Would require code change

### Option 3: Separate Y-Axes
**Pros:**
- Both datasets visible on linear scale
- Each dataset uses appropriate scale

**Cons:**
- Can be misleading (bars look similar height despite huge differences)
- More complex to implement
- Harder to compare actual values

### Option 4: Separate Charts
**Pros:**
- Each chart optimized for its data range
- Clear separation of stake vs create activity

**Cons:**
- Loses direct comparison capability
- Takes more screen space
- Not the intended design

## Recommendation

**Use the existing Linear/Log toggle - this is working as designed.**

The extreme scale difference (369 million X) is a real characteristic of the data:
- Creates involve massive TitanX amounts (billions)
- Stakes involve relatively tiny amounts (hundreds)

The logarithmic scale option is the industry-standard solution for visualizing data with such extreme ranges.

## User Education Approach

Instead of changing the code, we should:

1. **Add a help tooltip** near the chart title explaining:
   - "Stakes use much smaller TitanX amounts than creates"
   - "Click 'Log' to see both types of activity"

2. **Consider adding a note** below the chart:
   - "Note: Stake amounts are typically 100+ million times smaller than create amounts. Use logarithmic scale to view both."

3. **Update the chart description** to mention the scale toggle:
   - Current: "Shows the TitanX amounts used each day for both creates and stakes."
   - Suggested: "Shows the TitanX amounts used each day for both creates and stakes. Toggle to 'Log' scale to see stakes, which use 100M+ times less TitanX than creates."

## Technical Details

The scale differences by day:
- Day 1: Creates use 1.39 BILLION times more TitanX than stakes
- Day 2: Creates use 120 MILLION times more TitanX than stakes
- Day 5: Creates use 683 MILLION times more TitanX than stakes

This is not a bug - it reflects the actual protocol economics where:
- Creating positions requires massive TitanX burns (cost)
- Staking positions requires minimal TitanX (just gas-like fees)

## Conclusion

The chart is functioning correctly. The "invisible" stakes on linear scale accurately represent their minuscule size compared to creates. Users should use the logarithmic scale toggle to visualize both datasets simultaneously.
