# Shares Ending by Future Date - Days 105 & 106 Audit Report

**Date**: July 29, 2025  
**Issue**: Days 105 and 106 showing unusually small values in "Shares ending by future date" chart  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Root cause identified

## Executive Summary

The investigation revealed that Day 106 (and Days 107-108) show abnormally low values because create positions maturing on these days have **zero shares due to a calculation bug**, not missing data.

## Key Findings

### Day 105 (2025-10-22) - NORMAL
- **Total Shares**: 42,505,025 (42.5M)
- **Breakdown**: 30,976 from stakes + 42,474,049 from creates
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly

### Day 106 (2025-10-23) - PROBLEM IDENTIFIED  
- **Total Shares**: 108,416 (only from stakes)
- **Issue**: 29 create positions with significant principal amounts (11-6,905 ETH) all have **zero shares**
- **Root Cause**: Shares calculation bug affecting positions created on Days 17-18

### Days 107-108 - SAME ISSUE
- Both days show zero shares from creates due to same calculation bug

## Technical Analysis

### Data Integrity ✅
- All positions have complete data records
- No missing shares fields (shares property exists but equals 0)
- Maturity dates calculated correctly

### Affected Positions Pattern
- **Principal Amounts**: 11-6,905 ETH (substantial investments)
- **Created**: Days 17-18 (July 27-28, 2025)
- **Term**: Unknown/missing (likely 88 days based on maturity)
- **Expected Shares**: Should be substantial (normal ratio ~7,744 shares per ETH)
- **Actual Shares**: 0 for ALL positions

### Comparison with Working Positions
```
Working Position (Day 104):
- Principal: 10.98 ETH
- Shares: 84,999 (ratio: 7,744x)

Broken Positions (Day 106):
- Principal: 22.71 ETH → Shares: 0 ❌
- Principal: 888.54 ETH → Shares: 0 ❌
- Principal: 48.38 ETH → Shares: 0 ❌
```

## Impact Assessment

### Chart Display Impact
- Day 106 shows 108K instead of expected ~41M shares
- Days 107-108 show near-zero instead of expected significant values
- Creates false impression of low staking activity on these dates

### User Impact
- Misleading visualization for stakeholders
- Incorrect projections for "shares ending" analysis
- Potential confusion about protocol activity levels

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: Shares Calculation Bug
The shares calculation logic fails specifically for create positions made on Days 17-18, resulting in zero shares despite substantial principal amounts.

### Possible Technical Causes
1. **Term Length Missing**: Positions lack `term` field needed for calculation
2. **Timing Edge Case**: Positions created at specific timestamps trigger calculation failure
3. **Data Structure Change**: Create event structure changed between early and later positions
4. **Division by Zero**: Edge case in shares formula when certain fields are missing

## Verification Scripts Created

1. **`audit-shares-ending-days-105-106.js`** - Initial audit showing the discrepancy
2. **`deep-audit-day-106.js`** - Detailed analysis of Day 106 positions  
3. **`investigate-zero-shares.js`** - Root cause investigation revealing calculation bug

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Fix Shares Calculation Logic**
   - Identify why positions from Days 17-18 have zero shares
   - Implement proper shares calculation for affected positions
   - Add validation to prevent future zero-shares bugs

2. **Recalculate Affected Positions**
   - Run shares recalculation for ~70 affected positions across Days 106-108
   - Update cached data with corrected shares values
   - Verify chart displays correctly after fix

### Long-term Improvements (Medium Priority)
1. **Add Data Validation**
   - Implement checks for zero shares on substantial principals
   - Add alerts when shares calculation fails
   - Log warnings for positions missing critical fields

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Make shares calculation more robust to missing fields
   - Add fallback calculations for edge cases
   - Implement retry logic for failed calculations

## Files Modified/Created

- ✅ `tasks/shares-ending-audit-report.md` - This report
- ✅ `audit-shares-ending-days-105-106.js` - Initial audit script
- ✅ `deep-audit-day-106.js` - Detailed Day 106 analysis
- ✅ `investigate-zero-shares.js` - Zero shares investigation

## Next Steps

1. Review shares calculation logic in data collection scripts
2. Identify why positions from Days 17-18 specifically fail
3. Implement fix and test with affected positions
4. Update cached data and verify chart accuracy
5. Add monitoring to prevent future occurrence

---

**Conclusion**: The "unusually small" values for Days 105-106 were accurate for Day 105 but incorrect for Day 106 due to a shares calculation bug affecting create positions from Days 17-18. This is a data quality issue, not a chart display problem.
