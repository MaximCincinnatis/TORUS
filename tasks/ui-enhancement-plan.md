2. No feedback on what's loading

   - Shows current operation (e.g., "Fetching stake events...")
   - Estimated time remaining

2. **Skeleton Screens**
   - Metric card skeletons
   - Chart skeletons with animated shimmer
   - Maintain layout structure while loading

3. **Loading States**
   - "Connecting to Ethereum..." 
   - "Fetching stake events (0/203)..."
   - "Processing create events..."
   - "Calculating projections..."

### Phase 2: World-Class Design
1. **Modern Dark Theme**
   - Rich gradients and depth
   - Glassmorphism effects
   - Subtle animations
   - Professional color palette

2. **Enhanced Components**

3. **Professional Layout**
   - Better spacing and typography
   - Responsive grid system
   - Visual hierarchy
   - Smooth scroll behavior

### Phase 3: Performance & Polish
1. **Optimizations**
   - Stagger component loading
   - Smooth fade-in animations
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Error boundaries

2. **Final Touches**
