# LP Fee Burns Integration - COMPLETED âœ… (January 22, 2025)

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Fixed LP Fee Collection Event Tracking
- Identified that Collect events are emitted by the Uniswap V3 pool contract (`0x7ff1f30F6E7EeC2ff3F0D1b60739115BDF88190F`), not the NFT Position Manager
- Updated event signature and decoding to properly track fee collections
- Successfully found 2 historical LP fee collections totaling 180 TORUS burned

### 2. Updated Dashboard Metrics
- Total TORUS burned now includes both regular Buy & Burn operations (2,074 TORUS) and LP fee burns (180 TORUS)
- Added "LP Fee Burns" metric to the Cumulative TORUS Burned section showing "180 TORUS"
- Updated chart notes to mention LP fee collections

### 3. Created Tracking Infrastructure
- Created `track-buy-process-fee-burns.js` for initial LP fee burn discovery
- Created `update-lp-fee-burns.js` for incremental updates
- Created `update-all-burns.sh` to run both regular and LP fee burn updates
- Data stored in `public/data/buy-process-burns.json`

### 4. Dashboard UI Updates
- Daily TORUS burned chart now includes LP fee burns on the days they occurred
- Cumulative TORUS burned shows accurate total including all burn types (2,254 TORUS)
- Daily burns are properly merged by date to show combined totals

## Technical Details
- LP Position NFT ID: #1029195
- Owner: Buy & Process Contract (`0xaa390a37006e22b5775a34f2147f81ebd6a63641`)
- Burn Rate: 100% (all collected fees are burned)
- Historical Collections: 
  - Block 22898872 (July 11): 161.53 TORUS burned
  - Block 22929138 (July 16): 18.50 TORUS burned

## Implementation Approach
- Used `getLogs` API directly instead of ethers Contract filters
- Decoded Collect events manually to find Buy & Process collections
- Verified burns occur in same transaction as fee collections
- Integrated LP fee burns into existing chart calculations

## Key Findings
1. The protocol owns a significant LP position that earns trading fees
2. All collected fees are immediately burned (100% burn rate)
3. LP fee burns contribute meaningfully to the deflationary mechanics
4. These burns were not previously tracked in the dashboard

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `track-buy-process-fee-burns.js` - Discovery script for LP fee burns
- `update-lp-fee-burns.js` - Incremental update script
- `update-all-burns.sh` - Combined update script
- `test-collect-event.js` - Test script for event structure
- `test-specific-block.js` - Test script for specific block ranges
- `test-get-logs.js` - Test script for getLogs API
- `test-raw-logs.js` - Test script for raw log analysis

### Modified Files
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated burn calculations and metrics display
- `public/data/buy-process-burns.json` - New data file for LP fee burns
- `public/data/buy-process-data.json` - Regular burns data (unchanged structure)

## Testing & Validation
1. Verified Collect events are properly decoded
2. Confirmed burn transactions match fee collections
3. Tested daily burn aggregation includes both types
4. Validated total burns match sum of components
5. Ensured charts display combined data correctly

## Future Enhancements
1. Add historical chart showing LP fee burns over time
2. Display uncollected fees (currently 28 TORUS + 1.24B TitanX)
3. Add alerts when significant fees are ready to collect
4. Track fee APR for the protocol LP position
