# TORUS Staking Fee Analysis Complete

## Key Findings

### 1. Staking Always Requires Fees
When users stake TORUS tokens through the `stakeTorus` function, they MUST pay a fee in EITHER:
- **ETH**: Sent with the transaction (msg.value > 0)
- **TitanX**: Transferred from user's wallet

This is NOT optional - every stake requires fee payment.

### 2. Dashboard Already Tracks Fees Correctly

The dashboard implementation properly handles fee tracking:

#### Data Collection (update-all-dashboard-data.js)
- For ETH fees: Captured from transaction value
- For TitanX fees: Uses `getActualTitanXFromStake()` helper to extract from Transfer events
- Fallback to contract's stored values if extraction fails

#### Data Display (App.tsx)
- Lines 1738-1742: Calculate total ETH input from stakes and creates
- Lines 1744-1746: Calculate total TitanX input from stakes and creates
- Displays totals in dashboard metrics

### 3. Fee Distribution Mechanism

The fees are distributed as follows:
- Genesis wallet portion
- Burning mechanism (deflationary)
- Building fund
- TitanX burn (if paid in ETH, swaps to TitanX first)

### 4. Impact on ROI Calculations

The true cost of staking includes:
1. **Principal**: The TORUS tokens staked
2. **Fees**: ETH or TitanX paid (approximately 5% of creation cost)

This means users need higher rewards to break even compared to systems without fees.

## Dashboard Implementation Status

✅ **Correctly Implemented:**
- Fee extraction from blockchain events
- TitanX Transfer event parsing
- Total fee calculations
- Display of ETH and TitanX totals

✅ **Helper Functions:**
- `getActualTitanXFromStake()` properly extracts TitanX amounts
- Handles both ETH and TitanX payment methods
- Fallback mechanisms for data reliability

## Recommendations

1. **Add Fee Display to Individual Stakes**: While totals are shown, individual stake displays could show the fee paid

2. **ROI Calculations**: Should factor in the fee cost when calculating returns

3. **Fee Analytics**: Could add charts showing:
   - Daily fee collection
   - ETH vs TitanX fee preference
   - Fee distribution breakdown

## Technical Notes

The contract's `getStakePositions()` returns values that may be ETH-equivalent rather than actual TitanX amounts. The dashboard correctly handles this by:
1. First trying to get actual amounts from Transfer events
2. Falling back to contract values if needed
3. Properly formatting and displaying both scenarios

## Conclusion

The dashboard is correctly implemented to handle the dual-fee mechanism. Users always pay fees when staking, and these fees are properly tracked and displayed in the dashboard totals.
