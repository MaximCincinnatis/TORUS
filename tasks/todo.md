# TORUS Dashboard - Smart Update System for 30-Minute Updates

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Rate Limit Analysis**
   - Calculated ~360 RPC calls per full update
   - At 48 updates/day = 17,280 calls/day (potentially too high)
   - Determined need for smart incremental updates

2. **Smart Update Script Created**
   - `smart-update.js` - Minimizes RPC calls
   - Only updates when blockchain has new blocks
   - Incremental updates for most runs
   - Full update triggered only when needed

3. **Rate Limit Protection**
   - RPC provider rotation built-in
   - Tracks RPC calls per update
   - Logs all activity to `update-log.json`
   - Skips updates if <10 blocks since last run

4. **Testing Results**
   - Script successfully tested
   - Made only 2 RPC calls on smart update
   - Properly detects changes and pushes to git
   - Vercel auto-deploys on push

### 📊 Smart Update Features

1. **Minimal RPC Usage**
   - Checks block number first
   - Updates pool data only if changed
   - Checks for new LP positions only every 100+ blocks
   - Price updates are lightweight

2. **Intelligent Git Management**
   - Only commits if data actually changed
   - Descriptive commit messages with timestamps
   - Automatic push triggers Vercel deployment

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - `update-log.json` tracks all update history
   - `smart-update.log` captures console output
   - Tracks RPC calls, errors, and data changes

### 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Manual Test**
   ```bash
   node smart-update.js
   ```

2. **Set Up Cron Job (30-minute updates)**
   ```bash
   ./setup-cron.sh
   ```
   
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   # Add this line:
   */30 * * * * cd /path/to/torus-dashboard && node smart-update.js >> smart-update.log 2>&1
   ```

3. **Monitor Updates**
   ```bash
   # Watch live updates
   tail -f smart-update.log
   
   # Check update statistics
   cat update-log.json
   
   # View cron jobs
   crontab -l
   ```

### 📈 Expected Performance

- **Smart updates**: ~2-5 RPC calls (majority of runs)
- **Full updates**: ~360 RPC calls (only when needed)
- **Average**: ~20 RPC calls per update
- **Daily total**: ~960 RPC calls (well within limits)

### 🔧 Maintenance

- Check `update-log.json` weekly for any errors
- Monitor `smart-update.log` file size
- Rotate logs monthly if needed
- Adjust frequency if rate limits are hit

## Review Summary

The smart update system successfully reduces RPC usage by ~95% compared to running full updates every 30 minutes. It intelligently detects when updates are needed and minimizes git commits to only when data changes. This keeps the dashboard fresh while staying well within rate limits.

## Frontend Update Removal - Completed

### ✅ Tasks Completed

1. **Removed Update/Refresh Buttons**
   - Deleted all manual update functionality from App.tsx
   - Removed refresh button and its associated styling
   - Replaced with "Auto-updates every 30 minutes" text

2. **Frontend Now Cache-Only**
   - Modified loadData to only read from cached JSON files
   - No direct RPC calls from frontend
   - Backend handles all blockchain data updates

3. **Code Cleanup**
   - Removed unused imports (fetchStakeEvents, fetchCreateEvents, etc.)
   - Fixed React Hook dependency warning
   - Frontend compiles successfully with only minor warnings

4. **Testing Results**
   - Frontend starts and runs correctly
   - Data loads from cache as expected
   - No update buttons visible in UI
   - Auto-update message displays properly

The frontend is now fully decoupled from direct blockchain access, relying entirely on the backend's automated 30-minute updates via the smart-update.js system.

2. Verify frontend loads without errors
3. Confirm auto-update continues working every 30 minutes
4. Repository can now be made public if desired

## Critical Issues Fixed - 2025-07-16 (Part 2)

### 🎯 Problems Identified

1. **TitanX Price Range Formatting**
   - Price ranges displayed without commas (e.g., "202681.091 - 20158952.814")
   - Fixed by adding number formatting in LPPositionsTable component

2. **APR Calculations Completely Wrong**
   - Using hardcoded price of $0.00005 for TORUS (actual: $420.09)
   - Using $0.000000001 for TitanX (actual: $0.00001)
   - This made APR calculations off by ~8,400,000x for TORUS!

3. **Missing Stakes in Updates**
   - smart-update-fixed.js was NOT updating staking data at all
   - Only updating LP positions and pool data
   - New stakes were never being added to the dashboard

### ✅ Fixes Implemented

1. **Price Range Formatting**
   - Added `formatPriceRangeWithCommas` function to format numbers with commas
   - Now displays as "202,681.091 - 20,158,952.814"

2. **APR Calculation Fix**
   - Updated default TORUS price from $0.00005 to $420.09
   - Updated default TitanX price from $0.000000001 to $0.00001
   - APR calculations should now be much more accurate

3. **Staking Data Updates**
   - Added complete staking data update section to smart-update-fixed.js
   - Now fetches new stake and create events incrementally
   - Handles block ranges >10k by chunking requests
   - Preserves existing events while adding new ones

### 📊 Technical Details

The smart-update-fixed.js now:
- Updates pool data (existing)
- Updates LP positions (existing)
- **Updates staking data (NEW)**
- Updates prices (existing)

Staking updates include:
- Fetches from last cached block to current
- Processes both Staked and Created events
- Adds proper metadata tracking
- Only updates when >50 new blocks available

### 🚨 Important Notes

1. **APR values in cached JSON are still wrong** - They need to be recalculated with correct prices
2. **Need to run a full update** to get all missing stakes from recent blocks
3. **Monitor the auto-update** to ensure staking data is being captured

### 🔄 Next Actions Required

1. Run the updated smart-update-fixed.js to capture missing stakes
2. Consider running a full data refresh to recalculate all APR values
3. Monitor Vercel deployment with these fixes
4. Verify stake maturity schedule shows all stakes
