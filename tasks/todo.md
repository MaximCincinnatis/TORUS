# TORUS Dashboard - Update Scripts Status & Tasks

## 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Chart Shows 140M+ TORUS on Day 117 (IMPOSSIBLE!)

### Problem Statement
The chart is showing over 140 MILLION TORUS total supply on day 117, which is mathematically impossible.

### Mathematical Reality
- Daily TORUS pools from day 1-117: **11.17M TORUS TOTAL**
- Current supply: ~19K TORUS  
- Principal + new tokens: ~448K TORUS
- **Maximum possible supply: ~11.6M TORUS**
- **Chart is showing: 140M+ TORUS (12x too high!)**

### Investigation Findings
1. Daily reward pools are CORRECT (100K day 1, decreasing 0.08% daily)
2. Total pools day 1-117 = 11.17M TORUS ✅
3. Position shares values look inflated (280M shares for one position)
4. totalShares in pool data may have wrong scaling factor

### Current Issue Analysis
- The calculation is somehow distributing MORE TORUS than exists in the daily pools
- It's NOT about share distribution - it's about TORUS given per day exceeding the pool amount
- Need to find WHERE in the code we're multiplying rewards incorrectly

### ⚠️ REVERTED TO WORKING APPROACH - VERIFICATION REQUIRED!

#### The Real Issue:
1. Pool data totalShares (281M on day 111) differs from calculated totalShares (420M on day 111)
2. This 1.49x difference causes reward calculation mismatches
3. App.tsx was using calculated totalShares (working for daily chart)
4. maxSupplyProjection.ts was trying to use pool data (causing 140M issue)

#### Current Approach (BOTH USE SAME METHOD):
- **App.tsx**: Calculates totalShares from positions (UNCHANGED - was working)
- **maxSupplyProjection.ts**: NOW also calculates totalShares from positions (for consistency)
- Both charts now use the SAME calculation method
```javascript
// BOTH NOW USE:
let totalSharesForDay = 0;
positions.forEach(position => {
  if (date >= startDate && date < endDate) {
    totalSharesForDay += parseFloat(position.shares) / 1e18;
  }
});
```

#### Expected Result (NOT YET VERIFIED):
- Chart SHOULD show ~11.6M TORUS on day 117 (not 140M+)
- Daily rewards should NEVER exceed the daily pool amount
- Math should be consistent with on-chain distribution

### 🔴 CRITICAL: MANUAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED
**DO NOT MARK AS COMPLETE UNTIL:**
1. Browser is refreshed (Ctrl+F5 for hard refresh)
2. Navigate to "Maximum Possible Supply" chart
3. Scroll/pan to day 117
4. CONFIRM it shows ~11.6M TORUS (not 140M+)
5. Take screenshot or note exact value shown

### 🔴 NEW ISSUE: BROKE ANOTHER CHART!
**TORUS Principal and Share Supply Releasing Daily chart is now broken:**
- Chart no longer shows share supply data
- Must fix this regression while keeping the 140M fix

## Implementation Code

### 1. Update smart-update-fixed.js
Add type field when processing events (around line 370 for stakes, line 450 for creates):

```javascript
// For stake events (around line 370):
stakeEvents.forEach(event => {
  event.type = 'stake';  // Add this line
  // ... existing code
});

// For create events (around line 450):  
createEvents.forEach(event => {
  event.type = 'create';  // Add this line
  // ... existing code
});
```

### 2. Frontend Fix Already Applied ✅
The maxSupplyProjection.ts already has the fix to only count rewards from currentProtocolDay forward.

## Expected Results After Fix
- Current Supply: 18.4K TORUS
- New Tokens (creates): 438.3K TORUS  
- Principal (stakes): 6.0K TORUS
- Accumulated Rewards (from day 29+): 8.33M TORUS
- **Total Max Supply: 8.79M TORUS** (not 11.46M)

## Previous Completed Work

### ✅ totalShares Fix Applied
- Ran fix-totalshares-properly.js to recalculate all totalShares from actual position data
- All 117 days now have correct totalShares values
- Positions correctly earn higher rewards as competition decreases

### ✅ RewardPoolData Extended  
- Extended from day 112 to day 117 (currentProtocolDay + 88)
- Chart can now project to day 117 as intended

## Previous Issues (For Reference)

### ✅ FIXED: Duplicate Creates Issue Resolved

#### Summary
Successfully removed 138 duplicate creates from cached-data.json:
- **Before**: 1615 creates (with duplicates)
- **After**: 1477 creates (deduplicated)
- **All duplicates removed**: Verified 0 duplicates remain
- **Stakes unchanged**: 156 stakes preserved

#### What Was Done
1. **Fixed smart-update-fixed.js**: Updated deduplication logic to use `user-amount-timestamp` key
2. **Created deduplicate-creates.js**: Script to clean existing data
3. **Ran deduplication**: Removed 138 duplicates, kept versions with transaction hashes
4. **Verified fix**: Confirmed 0 duplicates remain in data

#### Result
- Charts should now show accurate create counts (~1477 instead of 1615)
- Future updates will prevent duplicates using improved deduplication logic
- Data integrity maintained - only removed true duplicates

### ✅ Scripts ARE Ready for Full Update

#### All Critical Fixes Completed

##### 1. Create Events Shares Fix ✅ 
- **Fixed**: All 1,352 create positions will now get shares data
- **Scripts updated**:
  - ✅ `update-all-dashboard-data.js` - Updated with creates shares matching logic
  - ✅ `update-all-dashboard-data-resumable.js` - Updated with creates shares matching logic
  - ✅ `update-creates-stakes-incremental.js` - Updated with creates shares matching logic

##### 2. TitanX Stake Amounts Fix ✅
- **Fixed**: Stakes now show actual TitanX amounts (e.g., 14,500,000 instead of 29)
- **All scripts updated** to use `getActualTitanXFromStake()` helper

##### 3. Testing Completed ✅
- ✅ Unit tests created and run successfully  
- ✅ TitanX extraction verified with on-chain data
- ✅ Incremental script tested and working
- ✅ Block range chunking added for large updates (10k blocks max)
- ✅ Script comparison FULLY VERIFIED - both scripts produce IDENTICAL outputs

### What's Fixed in All Scripts
- ✅ Creates shares extraction from matched positions
- ✅ TitanX amounts for stakes (using Transfer events)
- ✅ ETH vs TitanX fee detection
- ✅ Shared constants (ABIs, addresses)
- ✅ MaturityDate calculation for stakes
- ✅ Event decoding issues
- ✅ Reward pool data formula
- ✅ Block range chunking for incremental updates

### ✅ COMPLETED: Fixed Incremental Script Data Loss Issue
- [x] **IMMEDIATE**: Fix update-creates-stakes-incremental.js to never write empty data on error
  - ✅ Added error handling that preserves existing data
  - ✅ Added validation before writing any data
  - ✅ Creates automatic backup before overwriting cached-data.json
- [x] **Add proper 10k block handling**:
  - ✅ Checks block gap before fetching
  - ✅ Chunks requests into 10k blocks automatically
  - ✅ Never attempts to fetch >10k blocks in one request
- [x] **Data validation requirements**:
  - ✅ Never writes if both creates and stakes are empty AND there was an error
  - ✅ Logs detailed error messages but preserves existing data
  - ✅ Restores from backup if error occurs
- [x] **Recovery**: Restored the full update data
  - ✅ Re-ran full update with resumable script
  - ✅ Successfully restored 1,461 creates and 143 stakes
- [x] **Testing**: Verified the fix works
  - ✅ Created test script for data preservation
  - ✅ Confirmed existing data is preserved on error
  - ✅ Verified incremental updates work with chunking

## Development Standards Reminder
- **Simple & Accurate**: Make simple, incremental changes that are easy to understand
- **Leave it Better**: Every change should improve code clarity and maintainability
- **Test Thoroughly**: Test each fix before moving to the next
- **Verify Against Chain**: Always verify data accuracy against on-chain sources
- **Consistency**: Ensure all scripts produce identical data formats
- **Document**: Add clear comments explaining WHY, not just what
- **No Complexity**: Avoid clever solutions - prefer straightforward code
