# TitanX Usage Fix Report

## Issue Summary
The "Daily TitanX usage - creates vs stakes" chart was showing zero TitanX usage for protocol days 13 and 14, which seemed statistically unlikely given the high number of creates on those days.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Field Name Mismatch
- The chart frontend was looking for `titanXAmount` field
- Some creates had their TitanX data stored in `titanAmount` field instead
- This caused the chart to show zero even though the data existed

### 2. Smart Update Script Issue
- The `smart-update-fixed.js` script was hardcoding payment values to "0" for new events
- Lines 683-692 were setting `titanXAmount: "0"` and `rawCostTitanX: "0"`
- This prevented actual payment data from being captured during incremental updates

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Existing Data (Completed)
- Updated 37 creates to copy `titanAmount` values to `titanXAmount` field
- Day 13 now shows 23 creates with TitanX (out of 39 total)
- Day 14 now shows 12 creates with TitanX (out of 28 total)

### 2. Updated Smart Update Script
- Modified `smart-update-fixed.js` to fetch actual payment data from blockchain
- For new creates: Calls `userCreates()` to get titanAmount and ethAmount
- For new stakes: Calls `userStakes()` to get payment data
- Both functions now properly populate payment fields instead of hardcoding zeros

## Verification Results

### Creates by Day (Last Few Days)
- 2025-07-20: 32 total, 13 with TitanX (19,695M TitanX)
- 2025-07-21: 30 total, 24 with TitanX (52,217M TitanX)
- 2025-07-22: 39 total, 23 with TitanX (68,841M TitanX) ✓
- 2025-07-23: 28 total, 12 with TitanX (64,811M TitanX) ✓

### Stakes by Day
- Last stake with TitanX payment: July 18, 2025
- All stakes after July 18 were paid with ETH only
- This appears to be genuine user behavior, not a data issue

## Future Prevention

The updated `smart-update-fixed.js` script will now:
1. Fetch actual payment data for all new creates and stakes
2. Populate both `titanAmount` and `titanXAmount` fields for compatibility
3. Log warnings if payment data cannot be fetched
4. Properly track RPC calls used for fetching payment data

## Status
✅ JSON data fixed - Days 13-14 now show correct TitanX usage
✅ Smart update script updated to prevent future occurrences
✅ All creates have been audited and fixed
✅ Stakes verified (no TitanX payments after July 18 is correct)
