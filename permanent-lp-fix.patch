--- Fix for LP Position Field Mapping ---

The issue: Frontend expects 'torusAmount' and 'titanxAmount' fields, but backend provides 'amount0' and 'amount1'.

Since token0 = TORUS and token1 = TitanX, we need to ensure all LP position objects include:
- torusAmount = amount0
- titanxAmount = amount1

Changes needed in smart-update-fixed.js:

1. For existing positions (around line 267), add:
   torusAmount: amount0,
   titanxAmount: amount1,

2. For new positions (around line 345), replace:
   amount0: 0, // Frontend will calculate
   amount1: 0, // Frontend will calculate
   
   With:
   amount0: calculated.amount0,
   amount1: calculated.amount1,
   torusAmount: calculated.amount0,
   titanxAmount: calculated.amount1,

3. Ensure calculatePositionAmounts is called for new positions too.

This will permanently fix the issue and prevent regression.
