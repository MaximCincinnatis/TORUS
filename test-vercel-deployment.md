# Vercel Deployment Test Results

## Test Time: 2025-07-16T16:30:00Z

### Current Status: ❌ FAILED
Vercel is NOT automatically updating with GitHub pushes.

### Evidence:
1. **Local Data**: lastUpdated = 2025-07-16T15:55:56.889Z ✅
2. **GitHub Push**: Multiple commits pushed successfully ✅
3. **Vercel Production**: Still showing 2025-07-16T00:29:27.420Z ❌
4. **Build Hash**: main.287efbe0.js (unchanged) ❌

### Attempted Solutions:
1. ✅ Updated vercel.json with cache headers
2. ✅ Created Edge Function at /api/data
3. ✅ Modified source files to trigger rebuild
4. ✅ Added buildTimestamp.ts file
5. ❌ All attempts failed to trigger deployment

### Diagnosis:
The Vercel deployment appears to be:
- Not connected to GitHub auto-deploy
- Requiring manual deployment trigger
- Possibly misconfigured in Vercel dashboard

### Recommendations:
1. Check Vercel dashboard for deployment settings
2. Verify GitHub integration is enabled
3. Check for deployment failures/errors
4. Consider manual deployment via Vercel CLI

### Working Components:
- ✅ Local development server
- ✅ Update scripts preserve data
- ✅ GitHub repository updated
- ✅ Cron jobs configured
- ❌ Vercel auto-deployment
