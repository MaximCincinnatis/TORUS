# TORUS Dashboard Data Collection Audit Report
Date: July 29, 2025

## Executive Summary

I've implemented comprehensive fixes to address the root causes of data collection issues:

1. **Data Validation System** ✅
2. **Alert & Monitoring System** ✅  
3. **Automatic Recovery Mechanisms** ✅
4. **Enhanced Error Handling** ✅

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Missing Protocol Days (e.g., Day 18)
**Root Cause**: Date-based merging causing protocol day collisions
**Fix**: 
- Uses protocol day as primary key instead of date strings
- Automatic detection and recovery of missing days
- Validation ensures all days 1 to current are present

### 2. Zero ETH Values 
**Root Cause**: Silent RPC failures when fetching WETH events
**Fix**:
- Retry logic for all RPC calls (3 attempts with delays)
- Alert system logs failures instead of defaulting to 0
- Fallback RPC providers for redundancy

### 3. Missing Build Data
**Root Cause**: Incomplete data merging and silent failures
**Fix**:
- Comprehensive field validation
- Alerts when builds have 0 TitanX allocated
- Recovery fills in missing fields

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Data Validator (`scripts/data-validator.js`)
- Validates data integrity before and after updates
- Checks for:
  - Missing protocol days
  - Duplicate entries
  - Suspicious zero values
  - Date consistency
- Generates detailed reports

### 2. Alert System
- Logs all errors and warnings to `logs/data-alerts.log`
- Severity levels: ERROR, WARNING, INFO
- Timestamps and detailed error messages
- Persistent log for audit trail

### 3. Recovery Mechanisms
- **Fill Missing Days**: Automatically adds empty days for gaps
- **Remove Duplicates**: Keeps entry with most data
- **Fix Dates**: Ensures dates match protocol days
- **Retry Failed Operations**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff

### 4. Enhanced Update Script
- Multiple RPC provider fallbacks
- Retry wrapper for all blockchain calls
- Transaction receipt validation
- Comprehensive ETH detection with error handling
- Progress tracking and incremental saves

### 5. Monitoring System (`scripts/monitor-updates.js`)
- Checks update recency (alerts if >10 min delay)
- Analyzes error/warning counts
- Validates data integrity
- Generates health reports
- Can run via cron every 15 minutes

## Testing Results

```bash
# Validator Test
✅ Data validation passed!
⚠️  4 warnings found (historical data issues)

# Monitor Test  
1. Update Recency Check: ❌ FAIL (20.9 minutes)
2. Alert Log Analysis: ✅ PASS
3. Data Integrity Check: ✅ PASS
Overall Health: ❌ NEEDS ATTENTION
```

## Future Prevention

The automated updates will now:

1. **Validate Before Save**: Never save corrupted data
2. **Alert on Failures**: Log all issues for investigation  
3. **Recover Automatically**: Fix common issues without intervention
4. **Retry Operations**: Handle transient network issues
5. **Monitor Health**: Regular checks ensure system stability

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Run `node scripts/data-validator.js` to check current data
   - Set up monitoring: `bash scripts/setup-monitoring.sh`
   - Check alerts regularly: `tail -f logs/data-alerts.log`

2. **Ongoing Maintenance**:
   - Review monitor reports weekly
   - Investigate any ERROR level alerts immediately
   - Keep RPC provider list updated
   - Archive old alert logs monthly

3. **Long-term Improvements**:
   - Consider adding Discord/email alerts for critical errors
   - Implement data backups before each update
   - Add metrics tracking for update performance
   - Create dashboard for monitoring health

## Conclusion

The enhanced system provides:
- **Reliability**: Multiple fallbacks and retry logic
- **Transparency**: Comprehensive logging and alerts
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery for common issues
- **Monitoring**: Proactive health checks

These improvements ensure that data collection issues like missing days, zero ETH values, and incomplete build data will be detected immediately and often fixed automatically, preventing the cascading failures seen previously.
