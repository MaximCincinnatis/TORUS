# Daily Creates vs Stakes Chart - Implementation Audit

## Implementation Summary
Successfully added a new chart showing daily creates and stakes activity with the following features:

### 1. Data Collection ✓
- **Function**: `calculateDailyCreatesStakes()`
- **Logic**: 
  - Iterates through all `createData` and `stakeData` events
  - Calculates protocol day for each event based on `startDate`
  - Groups events by protocol day
  - Returns array with creates/stakes count for each day from Day 1 to current

### 2. Chart Features ✓
- **Type**: Bar chart with side-by-side bars
- **Date Range**: 7D, 30D, 60D, 88D, ALL options
- **Loading**: Uses new skeleton design with `chartType="bar"`
- **Progressive Loading**: Uses `chartsLoading` state
- **Styling**: 
  - Creates: Purple bars (rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.8))
  - Stakes: Yellow bars (rgba(251, 191, 36, 0.8))
  - Consistent with dashboard theme

### 3. Key Metrics ✓
- Total Creates: Shows total count from `createData.length`
- Total Stakes: Shows total count from `stakeData.length`
- Most Active Day: Calculates day with highest combined activity
- Total Days: Shows current protocol day

### 4. Chart Properties ✓
- **Height**: 600px (consistent with other charts)
- **Labels**: Y-axis shows "Number of Positions"
- **Scrolling**: Pannable with windowSize based on date range
- **Legend**: Shows "Creates" and "Stakes" labels
- **Stacked**: False (side-by-side bars)
- **Tooltip**: Shows exact count on hover

### 5. Position in Dashboard ✓
- Located directly after "Future TORUS Max Supply Projection"
- Before the commented-out "Future TORUS Supply Projection"
- Logical flow: Max Supply → Activity Analysis

### 6. Chart Note ✓
Explains:
- What creates are (mint new TORUS)
- What stakes are (lock existing TORUS)
- Day 1 reference date (July 10, 2025)

## Data Accuracy Check
The chart will accurately show:
- Day 1: First day activity when contract launched
- Each subsequent day: Actual count of create/stake transactions
- Current day: May show partial data if day is not complete

## Performance
- Calculation runs once when data loads
- Efficient O(n) algorithm where n = number of events
- No impact on other chart calculations

## Consistency
- ✓ Uses same date range buttons as other charts
- ✓ Uses same loading skeleton pattern
- ✓ Uses same chart styling and gradients
- ✓ Follows same progressive loading pattern
- ✓ Maintains dashboard's visual consistency

## Edge Cases Handled
- Empty data: Returns empty array if no events
- Missing days: Fills with 0 for days with no activity
- Current day: Includes up to current protocol day

## Integration
- State management properly integrated
- No conflicts with existing code
- Follows established patterns

## Build Status
✅ Build successful with no new errors
✅ Only existing warnings present

## Summary
The Daily Creates vs Stakes chart has been successfully implemented following all dashboard standards and best practices. It provides valuable insights into daily protocol activity patterns.
