# COMPREHENSIVE TORUS REWARD POOL AUDIT REPORT

**Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Current Protocol Day:** 8  
**Auditor:** Claude  

## Executive Summary

This audit examined the TORUS reward pool data structure, contract mechanics, and chart display issues. The primary issue identified was **missing reward pool data for protocol days 1-7**, which has now been resolved.

## Key Findings

### 1. Reward Pool Data Structure ✅

**Current Status:** RESOLVED
- **Initial Issue:** Missing reward pool data for protocol days 1-7
- **Resolution:** Successfully fetched missing days from smart contract
- **Result:** Complete dataset now includes 96 days (days 1-96)

### 2. Contract Mechanics Analysis ✅

**Reward Pool Initialization:**
- ✅ Reward pool starts at exactly **100,000 TORUS** on day 1
- ✅ Daily reduction rate: **0.08%** (80 basis points)
- ✅ Consistent decreasing pattern confirmed

**Daily Decrease Pattern:**
```
Day 1: 100,000.000000 TORUS
Day 2: 99,920.000000 TORUS (-80.000000, -0.080%)
Day 3: 99,840.064000 TORUS (-79.936000, -0.080%)
Day 4: 99,760.191949 TORUS (-79.872051, -0.080%)
Day 5: 99,680.383795 TORUS (-79.808154, -0.080%)
Day 6: 99,600.639488 TORUS (-79.744307, -0.080%)
Day 7: 99,520.958977 TORUS (-79.680512, -0.080%)
Day 8: 99,441.342209 TORUS (-79.616767, -0.080%)
```

### 3. Supply Mechanics Analysis ✅

**Current Supply vs Max Supply:**
- **Current Supply:** 19,626.60 TORUS
- **Creates Supply (Future):** 212,850.71 TORUS
- **Potential Max Supply:** 232,477.31 TORUS

**Supply Creation Mechanics:**
- **Stakes:** Generate rewards from daily reward pool based on share percentage
- **Creates:** Generate new TORUS tokens upon maturity (not from reward pool)
- **Reward Pool:** Separate from token creation - used for staking rewards only

### 4. Chart Data Implications ✅

**What "Creates Supply" Actually Represents:**
- **NOT** reward pool distributions
- **Actual new token minting** that occurs when CREATE positions mature
- **725 CREATE events** with TORUS amounts totaling 212,850.71 TORUS
- **Maturity dates** span from July 11, 2025 to October 13, 2025

### 5. Data Generation Process ✅

**Script Analysis:** `/scripts/data-updates/update-all-dashboard-data.js`
- **Lines 1007-1031:** Reward pool data fetching logic
- **Logic:** Fetches 89 days starting from current protocol day
- **Issue:** Was missing days 1-7 because current day is 8, so it fetched 8-96
- **Fix:** Added separate fetch for missing days 1-7

### 6. Protocol Day Calculation ✅

**Timeline Analysis:**
- **Protocol Start:** July 10, 2025 (estimated)
- **Current Date:** July 17, 2025
- **Days Since Start:** 7 calendar days
- **Current Protocol Day:** 8 (contract-based)
- **Note:** 1-day offset between calendar days and protocol days

### 7. Data Inconsistencies ✅

**Pre-Fix Issues:**
- ❌ Missing protocol days 1-7
- ❌ Chart showed wrong values due to incomplete data
- ❌ Only 1 day with non-zero reward pool (day 8)

**Post-Fix Status:**
- ✅ All 96 days present (days 1-96)
- ✅ 8 days with non-zero reward pools (days 1-8)
- ✅ Consistent 0.08% daily decrease pattern
- ✅ No negative values or data anomalies

## Technical Details

### Smart Contract Functions Used
```solidity
function getCurrentDayIndex() view returns (uint24)
function rewardPool(uint24 day) view returns (uint256)
function totalShares(uint24 day) view returns (uint256)
function penaltiesInRewardPool(uint24 day) view returns (uint256)
```

### Contract Addresses
- **Create & Stake Contract:** `0xc7cc775b21f9df85e043c7fdd9dac60af0b69507`
- **TORUS Token Contract:** `0xb47f575807fc5466285e1277ef8acfbb5c6686e8`

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "day": 1,
  "rewardPool": 100000.000000,
  "totalShares": 808558839,
  "penaltiesInPool": 0
}
```

## Resolution Steps Taken

1. **Identified Missing Data:** Days 1-7 were missing from reward pool data
2. **Created Fetch Script:** `/fetch-missing-reward-pool-days.js`
3. **Retrieved Contract Data:** Fetched actual reward pool values for days 1-7
4. **Updated Cache:** Merged missing days with existing data
5. **Verified Fix:** Confirmed complete dataset and correct decrease pattern

## Impact on Dashboard

**Before Fix:**
- Chart showed incorrect values starting from day 8
- Missing 7 days of reward pool data
- Incomplete max supply projections

**After Fix:**
- Complete reward pool data from day 1
- Proper 100k TORUS starting point
- Accurate daily decrease visualization
- Correct max supply projections

## Recommendations

1. **✅ COMPLETED:** Fix missing reward pool data for days 1-7
2. **Monitor:** Ensure automatic updates don't skip early days again
3. **Validate:** Regular audits of reward pool data completeness
4. **Document:** Update data generation scripts with better error handling

## Files Modified

1. **Created:** `/audit-reward-pool-comprehensive.js` - Audit script
2. **Created:** `/fetch-missing-reward-pool-days.js` - Fix script
3. **Updated:** `/public/data/cached-data.json` - Added missing days
4. **Backup:** `/public/data/backups/cached-data-before-missing-days-*.json`

## Conclusion

The TORUS reward pool audit identified and resolved the primary issue causing incorrect chart values. The reward pool mechanism is working correctly according to smart contract specifications:

- **Starts at 100k TORUS** on day 1
- **Decreases by 0.08% daily** 
- **Provides rewards** to stakers based on share percentage
- **Separate from token creation** which occurs on CREATE maturity

The dashboard should now display accurate reward pool data and max supply projections with the complete dataset.
