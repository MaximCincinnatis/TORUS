## Safe to Make Public
The repository contains:
- ✅ Public smart contract addresses
- ✅ Public contract ABIs
- ✅ Dashboard visualization code
- ✅ Data caching logic

## Recommendations
1. **Before making public**: 
   - The API key has been removed from main source files
   - Consider cleaning git history if needed (the key may exist in old commits)
   
2. **For production**:
   - Use environment variables for any API keys
   - Implement rate limiting on your own backend
   - Consider using a proxy for RPC calls

## Conclusion
With the API key removed, this repository is safe to make public. All remaining data is either public information or properly secured through environment variables.
